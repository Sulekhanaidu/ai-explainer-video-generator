    "text": "Black holes are born from massive stars. When a star runs out of fuel, it collapses under its own gravity. If it’s big enough—like 20 times the size of our Sun—it crushes into a tiny point called a singularity. Boom! A black hole is born. It’s like a giant star turning into a tiny, super-dense dot.",

    "text": "Black holes are invisible because light can’t escape them. So how do we find them? Scientists look for their effects, like stars orbiting ‘nothing’ or X-rays from hot gas spiraling in. It’s like hearing a lion’s roar in the dark—you can’t see it, but you know it’s there!",
    "image_prompt": "A telescope observing a star being pulled by an invisible black hole, with distorted light around it."

    "text": "Not all black holes are the same. Stellar black holes are a few times the Sun’s mass. Supermassive ones, like at our galaxy’s center, are millions or billions times heavier! Imagine a bowling ball versus a mountain—both are dense, but on totally different scales.",

    "text": "What happens if you fall into a black hole? You’d stretch like spaghetti—a process called ‘spaghettification’! The gravity near your feet would be way stronger than at your head, pulling you apart. Don’t worry, though—you’d never actually get there. It’s just a wild thought experiment!",

    "text": "Black holes aren’t eternal. They slowly lose energy and evaporate over billions of years, thanks to ‘Hawking radiation.’ It’s like a ice cube melting in the sun—just way, way slower. But don’t wait around; most black holes will outlast the universe!",

    "text": "In 2019, we saw the first-ever image of a black hole! The Event Horizon Telescope captured the supermassive black hole in galaxy M87. It looks like a fiery donut with a dark center—the shadow of the black hole itself. A huge leap for science!",

    "text": "Black holes can collide! When two merge, they create ripples in space-time called gravitational waves. In 2015, scientists detected these waves for the first time. It’s like hearing two cymbals crash together in space—but with gravity instead of sound!",

    "text": "Could a black hole swallow Earth? No need to panic! The nearest black hole is thousands of light-years away. Even if one replaced our Sun, we’d orbit it just like normal—though it’d be very cold and dark. Black holes are scary, but they’re not lurking around the corner!",

    "text": "Black holes are some of the universe’s most mysterious objects. They challenge our understanding of physics and spark endless questions. What’s inside? Could we travel through one? The more we learn, the more we realize how much we don’t know. Stay curious—the universe is full of wonders waiting to be discovered!",
