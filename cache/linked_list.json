    "image_prompt": "A treasure map with connected clues leading from one to the next, animated like a chain of boxes with arrows."

    "text": "Think of a linked list like a conga line! Each dancer holds onto the next person, forming a connected sequence. In a linked list, each 'node' holds data and a 'link' to the next node. If someone lets go, the line breaks—just like how links work in code! Simple, right?",
    "image_prompt": "A lively conga line of cartoon dancers, each holding the shoulders of the next, with labels showing 'data' and 'link'."

    "text": "Why use a linked list? Imagine a playlist where you can easily add or skip songs. Unlike a fixed CD, a linked list lets you insert or remove data without reshuffling everything. It’s flexible—perfect for dynamic stuff like game leaderboards or browser histories!",

    "text": "Meet the 'node'—the superhero of linked lists! Each node has two powers: storing data (like a photo or number) and pointing to the next node. It’s like a train car carrying cargo and coupled to the next car. No node? The list ends there. Poof!",
