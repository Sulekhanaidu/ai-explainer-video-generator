    "text": "Trains run on a simple but brilliant system: wheels on rails reduce friction, letting them move smoothly. Imagine sliding a book vs. rolling a pencil—it’s way easier to roll! Modern trains use magnets or electricity for extra speed and efficiency. Ever heard of maglev trains? They float above the track using magnetic levitation—no wheels needed! What other cool tech powers trains?",
