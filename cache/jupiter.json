    "text": "Imagine a planet so big that 1,300 Earths could fit inside it! That’s Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system. It’s a gas giant, meaning it’s made mostly of hydrogen and helium—just like the Sun, but not hot enough to shine. Think of it as a giant balloon floating in space, with no solid surface to stand on!",
    "image_prompt": "A massive, swirling Jupiter with tiny Earths floating around it to show size comparison, set against a starry space backdrop."

    "text": "Jupiter is like the solar system’s vacuum cleaner. Its huge gravity sucks in asteroids and comets, protecting Earth from potential impacts. Without Jupiter, our planet might get hit way more often! But don’t worry—Jupiter’s thick atmosphere burns up most of these space rocks before they cause any trouble.",
    "image_prompt": "Jupiter with a shield-like glow deflecting asteroids, while Earth sits safely in the distance."

    "text": "Ever seen Jupiter’s Great Red Spot? It’s a storm bigger than Earth that’s been raging for over 400 years! Picture a hurricane so huge it could swallow our planet whole. Winds here reach speeds of up to 430 km/h—that’s faster than a race car!",
    "image_prompt": "A close-up of Jupiter’s Great Red Spot, showing swirling red and white clouds with Earth superimposed for scale."

    "text": "Jupiter spins faster than any other planet—one day lasts just 10 hours! That’s so fast it bulges at the equator like a spinning pizza dough. If Earth spun that fast, you’d be flung into space! This speed also creates crazy-strong jet streams and storms across the planet.",
    "image_prompt": "Jupiter rotating rapidly, with visible equatorial bulge and streaking clouds, alongside a spinning pizza dough for analogy."

    "text": "Jupiter has 95 known moons—some with oceans, volcanoes, or even the potential for life! Europa, one of its largest moons, hides a salty ocean under its icy crust. Imagine alien fish swimming beneath miles of ice! Ganymede, another moon, is even bigger than Mercury.",
    "image_prompt": "Jupiter surrounded by its major moons, with Europa shown as an icy world cracking to reveal a hidden ocean beneath."

    "text": "Jupiter’s magnetic field is a monster—14 times stronger than Earth’s! It creates auroras so powerful, they’d make our Northern Lights look like a flashlight. These auroras are caused by charged particles racing along Jupiter’s magnetic field lines, lighting up its poles.",
    "image_prompt": "Jupiter’s vibrant auroras glowing at its poles, with Earth’s smaller auroras shown nearby for comparison."

    "text": "Jupiter’s atmosphere is a rainbow of chaos. Its colorful bands are made of clouds at different heights—white ammonia clouds up top, deeper red and brown clouds below. These bands move in opposite directions, creating wild weather patterns. It’s like a giant, turbulent oil painting in space!",
    "image_prompt": "Layered cross-section of Jupiter’s atmosphere showing colorful cloud bands, with swirling storms and contrasting wind directions."

    "text": "Want to hear something weird? Jupiter ‘sings.’ Its magnetic field produces eerie radio waves—if you could hear them, they’d sound like sci-fi laser blasts! These sounds come from charged particles dancing around Jupiter’s poles. NASA’s Juno spacecraft recorded these spooky space tunes.",
    "image_prompt": "An artistic depiction of Jupiter emitting glowing radio waves, with a stylized soundwave visualization and the Juno spacecraft nearby."

    "text": "Jupiter is like a mini solar system. Its four largest moons—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto—were discovered by Galileo in 1610. Io is the most volcanic place in the solar system, with eruptions bigger than anything on Earth. Imagine fireworks on steroids!",
    "image_prompt": "Jupiter with its four Galilean moons, focusing on Io erupting with massive volcanic plumes against the planet’s backdrop."

    "slide": 10,
    "text": "Jupiter holds clues to how our solar system formed. By studying it, we learn about the early days of planets, including Earth. Future missions might explore Europa’s ocean for life! So next time you look up, remember: Jupiter isn’t just a dot—it’s a dynamic, mysterious world shaping our cosmic neighborhood.",
    "image_prompt": "A futuristic scene of a spacecraft approaching Europa, with Jupiter looming large in the background and a silhouette of a researcher on Earth looking through a telescope."
