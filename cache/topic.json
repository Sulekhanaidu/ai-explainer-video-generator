    "text": "Ever seen a soda can ‘sweat’ on a hot day? That’s condensation—just like how water droplets form on leaves in the morning!

    "image_prompt": "A close-up of dewdrops on grass with a playful sun in the background, and a small plant releasing vapor into the air, blending into a cartoon-style cloud with a smiling face."
