    "text": "Imagine a city at night, with countless twinkling lights. Now, picture that on a cosmic scale—that’s a galaxy! A galaxy is a massive family of stars, planets, gas, and dust, all held together by gravity. Our Milky Way is just one of billions in the universe. Ready to explore? Let’s journey through the cosmos!",
    "image_prompt": "A vibrant night cityscape transitioning into a swirling galaxy, with stars and cosmic dust, evoking wonder."

    "text": "Galaxies come in different shapes, like cosmic snowflakes. Some are spiral, like the Milky Way, with elegant arms spinning like a pinwheel. Others are elliptical—smooth and round, like a football. There are also irregular galaxies, wild and messy, like a splatter of paint. Which shape do you think is the coolest?",
    "image_prompt": "Three side-by-side galaxy types: a spiral (Milky Way), an elliptical (smooth sphere), and an irregular (chaotic shape), with labels."

    "text": "Our home, the Milky Way, is a barred spiral galaxy. It’s so huge that light takes 100,000 years to cross it! Picture this: if the Milky Way were the size of a football field, our solar system would be a tiny speck on the 20-yard line. And guess what? We’re orbiting the galaxy’s center at 515,000 mph!",
    "image_prompt": "An overhead artistic view of the Milky Way with a football field overlay, showing our solar system’s relative size and position."

    "text": "At the heart of most galaxies, including ours, lurks a supermassive black hole. Don’t worry—it’s far away! Think of it like a cosmic vacuum cleaner with gravity so strong even light can’t escape. But it’s also what keeps galaxies spinning, like the anchor of a merry-go-round. Without it, stars would drift away!",
    "image_prompt": "A dramatic, glowing black hole at a galaxy’s center, with stars swirling around it like water down a drain."

    "slide": 5,
    "text": "Galaxies don’t exist alone—they form groups, like friends hanging out. The Milky Way is part of the ‘Local Group,’ with Andromeda as our nearest neighbor. Andromeda is racing toward us and will collide with the Milky Way… in 4 billion years! Don’t panic—stars are so far apart they’ll just dance around each other.",
    "image_prompt": "A playful illustration of the Milky Way and Andromeda as two cartoon galaxies waving, with a ‘collision countdown’ clock."

  {
    "slide": 6,
    "text": "Ever wondered how galaxies are born? After the Big Bang, gas and dust clumped together like cosmic cookie dough, forming stars and galaxies. The youngest galaxies we’ve spotted are over 13 billion years old—they’re like baby pictures of the universe! What secrets do you think they hold?",
    "image_prompt": "A timeline from the Big Bang (left) to modern galaxies (right), with glowing gas clouds forming early stars."

  {
    "slide": 7,
    "text": "Some galaxies are ‘active,’ meaning their centers shine brighter than millions of suns! This happens when their black holes feast on gas, shooting out jets of energy. It’s like a cosmic volcano erupting. These galaxies can help us understand how the universe evolves. What other cosmic mysteries are out there?",
    "image_prompt": "An active galaxy with bright jets of energy shooting from its core, contrasted against a dark space backdrop."

    "slide": 8,
    "text": "Want to see a galaxy? On a clear, dark night, you can spot Andromeda with just your eyes! It looks like a faint, fuzzy patch. Telescopes reveal its true glory—billions of stars. Fun fact: the light you see left Andromeda 2.5 million years ago, when early humans were just starting to walk upright!",
    "image_prompt": "A split image: left, a person stargazing; right, a zoomed-in view of Andromeda with a ‘2.5 million years ago’ label."

  {
    "slide": 9,
    "text": "Galaxies aren’t static—they evolve! They merge, grow, and sometimes ‘die’ when they run out of gas to form new stars. Our Milky Way has ‘cannibalized’ smaller galaxies over time. It’s like a cosmic food chain. What will our galaxy look like in a billion years? The universe is full of surprises!",
    "image_prompt": "A sequence showing two galaxies merging, with stars scattering like glitter, and a ‘then vs. now’ comparison."

  {
    "slide": 10,
    "text": "The universe has over 100 billion galaxies—each with billions of stars and planets. That means endless possibilities for life and discovery! Maybe one day, you’ll study galaxies or even visit one. Until then, keep looking up and asking questions. The cosmos is yours to explore. What’s your next space adventure?",
    "image_prompt": "A ‘telescope view’ of countless galaxies fading into the distance, with a ‘Your Journey Starts Here’ tagline."
