Take SpaceX’s Falcon 9: it burns fuel to create thrust, launching into space. Think of it as a controlled explosion pushing against the ground. How do you think scientists steer something so powerful?",

Modern rockets like NASA’s SLS carry supplies to the ISS. Imagine packing your lunch, but for a trip 250 miles above Earth! What would you send to space if you could design a mission?",
    "image_prompt": "A side-by-side illustration of the Saturn V rocket next to a skyscraper for scale, with a smaller modern rocket (like SLS) deploying a cargo capsule near the International Space Station."
