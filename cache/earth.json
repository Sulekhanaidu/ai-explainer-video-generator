    "text": "Welcome to a journey around our incredible planet—Earth! Think of Earth as a giant spaceship floating in the vast universe, carrying all of us and everything we know. It’s the only place we’ve found so far with life, water, and air to breathe. What makes Earth so special? Let’s find out!",
    "image_prompt": "A cartoon-style Earth floating in space, with a friendly sun in the background and stars twinkling around it."

    "slide": 2,
    "text": "Earth is like a layered cake! The crust is the thin, solid surface we walk on. Below is the mantle, a hot, squishy layer. Deeper still is the outer core, made of liquid metal, and the inner core—a super-hot solid ball. These layers create earthquakes, volcanoes, and even Earth’s magnetic field!",
    "image_prompt": "A cross-section of Earth showing its four main layers (crust, mantle, outer core, inner core), with playful labels and small volcano and earthquake icons."

    "slide": 3,
    "text": "Did you know Earth is mostly water? About 71% of its surface is oceans! That’s why it looks blue from space. Water shapes our planet—carving canyons, feeding plants, and even controlling the weather. Without water, life as we know it wouldn’t exist.",
    "image_prompt": "A view of Earth from space, emphasizing the blue oceans and white clouds, with a few tiny ships or whales to show scale."

  {
    "slide": 4,
    "text": "Earth’s atmosphere is like an invisible shield. It protects us from harmful space radiation and keeps our planet warm. The air we breathe is mostly nitrogen and oxygen. Without this thin layer, Earth would be as lifeless as the Moon!",
    "image_prompt": "A diagram of Earth surrounded by a glowing atmosphere, with meteors burning up in it and a rainbow gradient to show gases."

    "slide": 5,
    "text": "Earth is always on the move! It spins like a top, giving us day and night. It also orbits the Sun, creating seasons. Imagine if Earth spun slower—days would last months! Or if it tilted more—summers would be scorching, winters freezing. Our planet’s motion is just right for life.",
    "image_prompt": "An animated-style Earth tilted on its axis, with a bright sun shining on one side and a moon orbiting around it."

    "slide": 6,
    "text": "From towering mountains to deep ocean trenches, Earth’s surface is always changing. Mountains grow when tectonic plates collide, while erosion wears them down over millions of years. The Grand Canyon? Carved by a river! Earth’s face is a storybook of its past.",
    "image_prompt": "A colorful landscape with mountains, a river carving through a canyon, and tiny dinosaurs or fossils hinting at Earth’s history."
  },
  {
    "slide": 7,
    "text": "Earth is home to millions of species, from tiny bacteria to giant blue whales. Rainforests, deserts, coral reefs—each ecosystem is like a puzzle piece in Earth’s web of life. Even in freezing Antarctica or boiling hot springs, life finds a way!",
    "image_prompt": "A collage of diverse ecosystems (rainforest, desert, ocean, Arctic) with animals like a toucan, camel, dolphin, and penguin."

  {
    "slide": 8,
    "text": "Humans are changing Earth faster than ever. Cities grow, forests shrink, and pollution affects air and water. But we’re also learning to protect it—renewable energy, recycling, and conservation. What we do now shapes Earth’s future!",
    "image_prompt": "A split image: one side shows a polluted city, the other a green solar-powered town with wind turbines and happy wildlife."
  },
  {
    "slide": 9,
    "text": "Earth is full of mysteries! Why do continents move? How deep is the ocean? What’s inside a black hole? Scientists are still discovering new species and unlocking Earth’s secrets. Maybe YOU will solve the next big puzzle!",
    "image_prompt": "A whimsical lab scene with a young scientist (could be a cartoon student) examining a glowing Earth model, surrounded by question marks and tools."
  },
  {
    "slide": 10,
    "text": "Earth is our only home—let’s explore, protect, and marvel at it! Look outside: the clouds, the soil, the trees—all part of an amazing system. What’s your favorite thing about Earth? How will you help keep it healthy? The adventure is just beginning!",
    "image_prompt": "A group of diverse kids planting a tree together, with a bright sun, green hills, and a clean river in the background."
