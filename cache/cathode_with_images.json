    "text": "Have you ever wondered how batteries power your devices? Meet the cathode â€“ the unsung hero inside every battery! The cathode is the positive electrode where magical chemistry happens. When a battery is in use, electrons flow from the negative side (anode) to the cathode, creating the electricity that powers your phone, flashlight, or even an electric car. Without cathodes, our gadgets would be lifeless! Fun fact: The word 'cathode' comes from Greek, meaning 'way down,' because it's where electrons 'descend' during discharge.",
