    "text": "Imagine exploring the deepest parts of the ocean, where sunlight never reaches. Submarines make this possible! These incredible machines can dive thousands of meters below the surface, uncovering ocean secrets. From scientific research to underwater adventures, submarines are like underwater spaceships. Ready to dive in and discover how they work?",
    "image_prompt": "A futuristic submarine exploring a vibrant underwater world with glowing sea creatures and sunrays piercing the dark blue water."

    "text": "Submarines aren’t new—Leonardo da Vinci sketched early designs in the 1500s! The first working submarine, the 'Turtle,' was used in 1776 during the American Revolution. It was human-powered and made of wood—nothing like today’s high-tech versions. Think of it like comparing a bicycle to a sports car!",
    "image_prompt": "A side-by-side comparison: a wooden, barrel-shaped submarine with hand cranks next to a sleek modern nuclear submarine."

    "slide": 3,
    "text": "How do submarines sink and float? It’s all about buoyancy! They use ballast tanks—like giant balloons—filled with water to dive or air to rise. Picture a scuba diver adjusting their weight belt, but on a massive scale. The submarine’s crew carefully controls this to glide through the ocean depths.",
    "image_prompt": "A cross-section of a submarine showing ballast tanks filling with water (sinking) and releasing air (floating), with arrows illustrating the process."

    "slide": 4,
    "text": "Ever wondered how submarines 'see' underwater? They use sonar—sound waves that bounce off objects, like echolocation in dolphins. This helps them navigate dark waters and avoid obstacles. Some submarines even have periscopes to peek above the surface, just like in spy movies!",
    "image_prompt": "A submarine emitting sonar waves (blue concentric circles) detecting a shipwreck, with a periscope breaking the water’s surface under a starry sky."

    "text": "Nuclear submarines are the ultimate underwater powerhouses. They use tiny amounts of uranium to create years of energy—no refueling needed! This lets them stay submerged for months. It’s like having a backpack-sized battery that powers your phone for a lifetime. The USS Nautilus, the first nuclear sub, even traveled under the North Pole!",
    "image_prompt": "A nuclear submarine under Arctic ice, with a glowing reactor core visible in a cutaway view, surrounded by polar bears on the ice above."

  {
    "slide": 6,
    "text": "Life onboard is like a space station under the sea! Crews work in tight spaces, sleep in bunk beds, and grow fresh food hydroponically. They even recycle their air and water. Imagine living with 100 people in a moving metal tube for months—teamwork is everything!",
    "image_prompt": "A cozy yet crowded submarine interior: crew members playing chess, tending to plants, and monitoring controls in a well-lit compartment."

    "text": "Submarines help science in amazing ways. They study deep-sea volcanoes, map uncharted trenches, and discover new species. The Alvin submersible found the Titanic! Think of them as underwater labs—every dive could reveal something no human has ever seen.",
    "image_prompt": "A small research submarine (like Alvin) with robotic arms collecting samples near a hydrothermal vent, surrounded by strange deep-sea creatures."

    "slide": 8,
    "text": "The Mariana Trench is the deepest ocean point—almost 11,000 meters down! Only special subs like James Cameron’s Deepsea Challenger can go there. At that depth, pressure is like balancing an elephant on your fingernail. Yet, life thrives even there—proof of how adaptable nature is!",
    "image_prompt": "A futuristic deep-sea submersible illuminated by spotlights in the pitch-black trench, with bizarre translucent fish swimming nearby."

    "text": "What’s next? Engineers are designing autonomous submarines that explore oceans on their own, like underwater drones. Some may even search for alien life in icy moons like Europa! The ocean covers 71% of Earth—we’ve explored less than 20%. The future of submarine tech is wide open.",
    "image_prompt": "A sleek AI submarine with holographic controls scanning an alien underwater ice cave, with a distant glow suggesting unknown lifeforms."

    "slide": 10,
    "text": "Submarines show human ingenuity—from wooden prototypes to high-tech explorers. They remind us that Earth’s oceans are our final frontier. Maybe YOU’LL design the next breakthrough! What would your dream submarine do? Dive deeper? Explore other planets? The ocean’s mysteries are waiting.",
    "image_prompt": "A diverse group of teens brainstorming submarine designs in a high-tech lab, with holograms of futuristic subs and ocean maps floating around them."
