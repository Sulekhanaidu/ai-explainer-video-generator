    "text": "Did you know trees are like the Earth’s lungs? They breathe in carbon dioxide and breathe out oxygen, keeping our air fresh. Just like you need breakfast to grow, trees need sunlight, water, and nutrients. Imagine a giant oak tree starting as a tiny acorn—now that’s some serious growth!",
    "image_prompt": "A vibrant, sunlit forest with rays of light filtering through tall trees, showing leaves and a small acorn sprouting into a seedling."

    "text": "Trees are nature’s superheroes! Their roots hold soil together, preventing floods and landslides. Think of them like giant sponges soaking up rainwater. A single tree can drink hundreds of gallons of water a year—way more than you do in a lifetime!",
    "image_prompt": "A cross-section of soil showing tree roots gripping the earth, with water droplets being absorbed and a small stream nearby."

    "slide": 3,
    "text": "Ever hugged a tree? (No judgment!) That rough bark is like armor, protecting the tree from insects and fire. Some trees, like the mighty redwoods, have bark so thick it can survive wildfires. Talk about tough!",
    "image_prompt": "A close-up of tree bark with intricate textures, insects crawling on it, and a small flame bouncing off the surface harmlessly."

    "text": "Trees are the ultimate multitaskers. They provide homes for birds, squirrels, and even tiny bugs. A single tree can host thousands of species—like a buzzing apartment building for nature!",
    "image_prompt": "A lively tree canopy with birds nesting, squirrels jumping between branches, and insects like butterflies and beetles scattered throughout."

    "slide": 5,
    "text": "From apples to chocolate, trees give us delicious treats. But they also make life sweeter in other ways—like maple syrup! It takes about 40 gallons of sap to make just one gallon of syrup. That’s a lot of pancake breakfasts!",
    "image_prompt": "A smiling person tapping a maple tree for sap, with bottles of golden syrup and a stack of pancakes drizzled with syrup nearby."

    "slide": 6,
    "text": "Trees are like time travelers. Their rings tell stories of droughts, storms, and even volcanic eruptions. A bristlecone pine in California is over 5,000 years old—it was already ancient when the pyramids were built!",
    "image_prompt": "A close-up of a tree stump with visible rings, each labeled with historical events like 'Volcano Eruption' or 'Drought.'"

    "slide": 7,
    "text": "Trees talk to each other—sort of! Through underground fungal networks, they share nutrients and even warn about pests. It’s like their own version of the internet, nicknamed the 'Wood Wide Web.'",
    "image_prompt": "An underground view of tree roots connected by glowing fungal threads, with tiny 'messages' traveling between them like chat bubbles."

    "slide": 8,
    "text": "Some trees have crazy survival tricks. The baobab stores thousands of gallons of water in its trunk—like a natural water tank! And the mangrove grows in salty water, filtering out salt through its roots. Nature’s engineers!",
    "image_prompt": "A baobab tree with a massive trunk standing in a dry landscape, alongside a mangrove tree with roots submerged in ocean water."

    "text": "Deforestation is like deleting files from Earth’s hard drive—once they’re gone, it’s hard to recover. But we can help! Planting trees, recycling, and supporting forests can keep our planet healthy. What’s one small thing you can do today?",
    "image_prompt": "A split image: one side shows a lush forest, the other a barren field with a person planting a young sapling in the middle."

    "text": "Next time you pass a tree, give it a high-five (gently!). These silent giants clean our air, protect our homes, and even inspire art and stories. So go explore—climb, sketch, or just relax under their shade. The world is greener with trees in it!",
    "image_prompt": "A diverse group of students laughing under a large tree, some drawing, others reading, with sunlight streaming through the leaves."
