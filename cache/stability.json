    "text": "What keeps a skyscraper standing tall during a storm? Or a bicycle balanced while riding? The answer is stability! Stability is what keeps things steady, strong, and resistant to change. Whether it’s a tree bending in the wind or your favorite chair holding you up, stability is everywhere. Let’s explore how it works in our world!",
    "image_prompt": "A skyscraper standing firm during a storm, with wind and rain swirling around it, while a bicycle rider balances effortlessly nearby."

    "text": "Think of stability like a three-legged stool. If one leg is shorter, the stool wobbles. But with all legs equal, it’s rock solid! This is called balance. In life, stability often depends on having multiple supports—like friends, family, and habits—working together to keep you steady. What are your ‘three legs’ that help you stay balanced?",
    "image_prompt": "A three-legged stool on uneven ground, one leg slightly shorter, with a backpack and books symbolizing support systems nearby."

    "text": "Ever seen a tightrope walker? They use a long pole to stay stable. The pole lowers their center of gravity, making them less likely to tip over. Cars, ships, and even your body use the same trick! A low center of gravity = better stability. Try standing on one leg with your arms wide—feel how your body adjusts?",
    "image_prompt": "A tightrope walker holding a long pole mid-air, with a glowing dot highlighting their center of gravity, and a kid mimicking the pose on solid ground."

    "text": "Nature loves stability. A pyramid’s wide base keeps it standing for thousands of years, just like the roots of an ancient tree. The wider the base, the harder it is to topple! Even your phone’s tripod uses this idea. Can you spot other objects around you with wide bases for stability?",
    "image_prompt": "A pyramid next to a massive tree with sprawling roots, and a smartphone on a tripod, all with glowing outlines emphasizing their wide bases."

    "text": "Not all stability is physical! Emotional stability is like an anchor in rough seas. Breathing deeply when stressed or talking to a friend are ways to ‘widen your base.’ Even video game characters have health bars—their stability! What helps you stay emotionally steady during tough times?",
    "image_prompt": "A teen sitting cross-legged and breathing deeply, with a stormy sea metaphor fading into calm waves, and a simple video game HUD overlay."

    "text": "Check this out: A bowling pin falls easily, but a bowling ball stays put. Why? Weight distribution! Dense, evenly spread weight increases stability. That’s why sumo wrestlers crouch low and why your water bottle doesn’t tip over when full. Heavy isn’t always bulky—it’s about how the weight is arranged!",
    "image_prompt": "A bowling ball and pin side by side, with a sumo wrestler in stance, and a half-full vs. full water bottle, arrows showing weight distribution."

    "text": "Ever stacked rocks at the beach? The flattest ones go on the bottom. That’s structural stability! Engineers use this principle in bridges and towers. Even your backpack is stable when heavy books are at the bottom. Next time you pack or build, think: How can I arrange things to stay steady?",
    "image_prompt": "A balanced rock tower on a beach, a suspension bridge, and a backpack with books at the bottom, all with color-coded layers."

    "text": "Stability isn’t just about standing still—it’s about recovering too. A spring pops back after being pressed. That’s resilience! Your body does this when you trip, and ecosystems do it after disasters. Practice bouncing back: Learn from mistakes, adapt, and grow stronger. What’s your ‘spring’ made of?",
    "image_prompt": "A coiled spring bouncing back, a kid tripping but catching themselves, and a forest regrowing after a fire, with dynamic motion lines."

    "text": "Team sports rely on group stability. Soccer players pass to keep balance under pressure. Bees work together to keep their hive steady. Even atoms bond for stability! Collaboration creates strength. Who’s on your team to help you stay stable—in class, sports, or life?",
    "image_prompt": "Soccer players passing a ball, a beehive with worker bees, and a molecular bond diagram, all connected by glowing teamwork threads."

    "text": "Now it’s your turn! Build a stable tower from spaghetti and marshmallows, or design a paper bridge. Test it—does it hold weight? Bend without breaking? Stability is science in action! Look around: Where else can you spot or improve stability? Stay curious, and keep things steady!",
    "image_prompt": "Hands building a spaghetti-marshmallow tower, a paper bridge holding coins, and a magnifying glass zooming in on everyday stable objects."
